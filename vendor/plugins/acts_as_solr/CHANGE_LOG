[CHANGE_LOG]
11-07-2006:
========================
[NEW] Added :background option, which takes and integer value (in minutes) to wait before committing the changes to Solr.  This depends on rail_cron being installed.  By setting up the background job we prevent the users from having to wait for Solr records to be created, and we keep from updating the index over and over for quickly successive changes. (Rob Kaufman)
